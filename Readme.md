Hi ho, hi ho! It's off to work we go! Welcome, dear reader, to the ever changing, ever growing Capstone project of me, Ryan O'Boyle! As I did not see specific instructions on what to fill this Readme with, it shall be filled with details of my project, but, with flair! So, as we begin, the probing questions I have for this data set began to overwhelm me. After a bit of tinkering I realized I could examine the gender/amount of heroes and villains. What I think this may allow me to plot and display, is how often one gender or another is a hero or villain and whether heroes overwhelm villains for both DC/Marvel. In keeping with that line of reasoning, I have begun to flesh out various graphs to demonstrate those results. I hope I am not misunderstanding the design of this, but I used bar graphs because it was easy to visualize. Depending on the later material, I plan to flesh this out into a heat map, a pie chart, and a scatterplot to help detail different visuals to demonstrate what I believe the data shows and why. I used a virtual environment (python -m venv env) (Although I think it may have also generated another one automatically but I do not understand it enough to tinker with and fix it) then in the commandline (I used gitbash) pip install requests. I also made sure to import all of the libraries required so that I could use them to load the graphs.
